# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first paragraph of my first blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## About This Blog

Here is some information about the blog. It's built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that makes it easy to create and maintain a blog.

```python
# Here is a sample Python code snippet
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
